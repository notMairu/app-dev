**Plastic Memories** is an *emotional sci-fi anime* set in a future where human-like androids called "Giftias" are created to assist people. 
These androids have a limited lifespan of about nine years and four months, after which they begin to experience memory loss and personality degradation. 
The story follows Tsukasa Mizugaki, a young man who starts working at the Terminal Service Department, whose task is to retrieve Giftias whose lifespan is nearing its end. 
Tsukasa is paired with a Giftia named Isla, who has only a short time left, and their relationship becomes the centerpiece of the series, exploring themes of love, mortality, and the nature of humanity amidst the backdrop of a technologically advanced world.

## World Building
### Giftias

Giftias are highly advanced androids created to resemble humans both in appearance and behavior, equipped with sophisticated artificial intelligence, emotions, and the ability to learn and adapt. Giftias are designed to assist people in various tasks, serving as companions, workers, or helpers in different capacities based on their programming. One of the most significant aspects of Giftias is their ability to form emotional connections with humans. They can express feelings, develop personalities, and engage in relationships, leading to deep bonds with their owners or those they interact with regularly.

### Lifespan
Giftias have a crucial limitation: they have a fixed lifespan of about nine years and four months. As they approach the end of this lifespan, they begin to experience memory loss and personality degradation, eventually losing their functionality and becoming potentially hazardous if not retrieved in time.

### Terminal Service Department

The **Terminal Service**, also known as the **Retrieval Department**, is a department of the **SAI Corporation** that is responsible in the retrieval of Giftia who are already nearing the end of their lifespan. The department operates with retrieval teams consisting of human employees paired with Giftias. These teams are deployed to locate and retrieve Giftias whose expiration date is imminent. They interact with both the Giftia and its owner or those associated with it to ensure a smooth retrieval process.
Once a Giftia is retrieved, the Terminal Service Department takes measures to properly deactivate and retrieve its memories, ensuring the preservation of any significant or cherished experiences the Giftia had with its human companions.
